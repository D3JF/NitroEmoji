# NitroEmoji
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/07PFZqy.png"> NitroEmoji is a small application that allows Discord users without an active Nitro subscription to automatically download and use custom emojis from servers that they are members of. It also supports cloning custom emojis, given the appropriate emoji ID.

## Features
* Login with session token or email/password
* Request available servers
* Request available emojis
* Download and resize static and animated emojis
* Add custom emojis
* Use saved emojis in other Discord conversations

**Currently, saved emojis appear distorted on mobile versions of Discord.** This is due to Discord's platform-dependent handling of low resolution images.
